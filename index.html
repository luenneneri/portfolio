            Grupo ZAP (the leading real estate tech company in Brazil) was born from the merger of Viva Real and ZAP im√≥veis, two very similar, but individually complex products designed to help people's journeys in the search for a new home. Not
            surprisingly, the merger of the two most prominent names in the industry ‚Äì as beneficial as it was ‚Äì came with a new set of challenges for the company in most areas.</p>
          <p>For the Design, Product, and Engineering team, for almost two years, such challenges surrounded the integration of both platforms, encompassing system makeovers, usability issues, consolidation of two cultures, and changes in the
            company's strategies.</p><span id="dots"></span><span id="more" style="display: none;">
            <p>ZAP Im√≥veis, the most recognized consumer's product, centralized the majority of the technical issues. So when Engineering started approaching the integration of the systems, we saw an opportunity to rethink the experience of the
              portal,
              which lacked accessibility, design principles, UI consistency, and didn't address the consumer's journey adequately.</p>
            <p><strong>The redesign journey consisted in:</strong><br>
              1. conciliating business needs: what brought value to the page<br>
              2. user journey: tackling the emotional and rational trajectory of finding a home<br>
              3. territories: which principles our visual identity should reveal<br>
              4. testing: validating the listing page experience as an MVP<br>
              5. foundations: translating our principles to the screen<br>
              6. outcome & scale: building the remainder of the portal's pages

            While working on the redesign of one of our consumer-facing products,
            to avoid watching the design team become a bottleneck in the process,
            I sat down with our front-end developers to align and properly prioritize our next moves.
            After discussions about the concept and similarities between tokens and atomic design,
            we were able to define naming and other basic rules to create new components, making the
            redesign process more efficient and cohesive.
            <br><br>
            Even though we had tried to develop a system before as a design team, kickstarting with
            the making of our products' libraries, Lina ‚Äì our design system named after a phenomenal
            female architect, only became tangible when it meant solving a problem that involved user,
            business, and execution. By adjusting inconsistencies in design foundations, getting two
            recently merged teams more familiar with the other product, and fixing duplicate code, we were
            finally equipped to honor one of the company's values properly: do more agile experiments
            to gather evidence and insights to build better products.

            hourglass is a tool that seeks to facilitate the work/life balance dialogue in the workplace,
            reducing work-related anxiety through improved communication, setting more explicit expectations
            for the employees, and shaping a culture that recognizes employees who care for themselves.
            <br>
            <br>
            The project started with researching different topics for mental and affordable health and how people
            explore their home cities. In the interview phase for these topics, however, work was the subject
            that stood out as the leading influencer in decisions related to them. So much so that the word "fatal"
            was used multiple times to describe career-related failures.
            <br>
            <span id="dots-hourglass"></span><span id="more-hourglass" style="display: none;">
            <br>
            With this problem in mind, the focus was to help companies and managers change their employees'
            relationships with work. Nonconforming of crooked motivations, such as simply improving employee
            productivity, this product's vision was to improve communication, provide a sense of community,
            and promote the non-romanticization of work overload.
            <br>
            <br>
            After rounds of quantitative and qualitative research, grounded on the evidence and insights drawn
            from this process, the decision for the MVP was to:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. facilitate the transparency about the most stressful factors.<br>
            2. understand employers' intentions with this tool to make the provision of data more personalized.<br>
            3. provide mechanisms for the employees to argument raises and promotions.<br>
            4. emphasize the importance of ceremonies such as 1: 1's and dates such as holidays and days off.<br>
            5. provide the means to build a proper career plan

            December 2019, when I still had high hopes for 2020, I decided to learn Chinese on Duolingo.
            But, as Chinese is a tough language to learn, having a 100-day streak pretty much meant
            I could only understand when people asked my name.
            <br><br>
            One of the things that makes this learning process so slow is that each lesson covers
            about 10 completely new characters. And writing the figures down by itself would already
            take me a lot of time, so I made myself a sketch library to keep track of the new information.
            <br><span id="dots-cms"></span><span id="more-cms" style="display: none;"><br>
            As I progressed on the course, I realized this technique wouldn‚Äôt last long, due to the endless
            combinations and meanings, and keeping track of that was becoming harder.
            That is when I had the opportunity to build a CMS-based product for personal use, as an MVP of a digital notebook
            for people trying to learn new languages with different alphabets.

            Gather was the result of research about women's rights to urban spaces. By continually keeping our eyes on the screen late at night, we're often making ourselves more vulnerable (no, we don't believe that it's our fault).
            <br><br>
            This app was created to connect women who might share the same paths on their daily routines so that they can get out of their phones and team up to feel safer while commuting.
            <br>
              <br>
              The product focuses on safer commutes in two ways:<br><br>
              1. Making compatible connections<br>
              2. Opt to having someone watching your trip for you
              <span id="dots-gather"></span><span id="more-gather" style="display: none;">
                <br>
              <br>
              Gather was not conceived as a definitive solution to women's safety, though, as it's seen as a palliative alternative to a very systemic issue. The lack of trust in such products due to bad experiences with apps that addressed gender
              issues was the other problem.
              <br><br>
              As noticed throughout the competitive analysis and in the interview phase, many are built prematurely without understanding the actual problem they want to solve, often based on what we know about these oppressions historically added to
              a deficiency of quality data.
              <br><br>
              Based on that, Gather data ‚Äì a live document fed by ongoing research ‚Äì would live inside the Gather app, providing an open dataset for those attempting to build better-informed products regarding women's safety in urban spaces.

            Along with the discussion about more sustainable behaviors and the exaggeration of meat consumption in the world, Verd√®a came as a product to help people transition into a meatless lifestyle.
            After research it was observed that people usually make a slow transition to veganism, so the chosen approach was to resort to a gradual change in the user's feeding behavior, based on their current habits.
