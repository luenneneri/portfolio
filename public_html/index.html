          <p>
            After the merger of VivaReal and Zap Imóveis – the two leading real estate tech companies in South America – the company had to cope with the integration of two distinctive tech teams.
            <br><br>As the engineering teams made the integration of the systems, the design team saw the opportunity to rethink the strategy under one of the portals' design, which had problems in accessibility, duplicate code, and no logic behind
            the use of its typography, colors, and components throughout the portal.

            Lina: from the atom to scalability.
          </h2>
          <p>
            When the subject of design systems became popular, it was easy to spot a few teams building theirs out of a mere willingness to belong.
            We sure tried to fit in as well by making Sketch libraries and fooling ourselves that we were in the right direction – we wanted to be trendy too 💁🏽‍♀️.
            But this is a story about a design system that only became tangible when it meant the solution for one – or maybe 5 – of our problems.
            <br><br>
            By adjusting inconsistencies in design identity, getting two new teams more familiar with new products, and fixing duplicate code, we were finally equipped to honor one of the company's values properly:
            do more agile experiments to gather evidence and insights to build better products.

            Gather app
          </h2>
          <p>
            Gather was the result from a research about women’s rights to urban spaces. It was evident that we’re making ourselves more vulnerable (<em>and no, it’s not our fault</em>) by constantly keeping our eyes on the screen late at night, in
            our commutes.
            <br><br>
            This app was created to connect women that might share the same paths on their daily routine, so that they can get out of their phones and team up to feel safer while commuting.

            Gather data is a live document fed by an ongoing research that exists inside the Gather app (yep, the one up in here 👆🏽).
            <br><br>
            It originated from the idea of building an open dataset that could collaborate on building more informed products towards women's safety.

          <p>
            Along with the discussion about more sustainable behaviors and the exaggeration of meat consumption in the world, Verdèa came as a product to help people transition into a meatless lifestyle.<br><br>
            After the research phase, where it was observed that people usually make a slow transition to veganism, the chosen approach was to resort to a gradual change in the user's feeding behavior, based on their current habits.
